To understand the implementation of infinite scroll, we need to know about some events first.

1. window.innerHeight
    -   This gives us the height of viewport (Height of the page that we can view without scrolling).

2. document.body.scrollHeight
    -   This will give the height of the whole web-page.

3. window.scrollY
    -   This gives us how much we scrolled the webpage in y-axis.

Formula = window.scrollY + window.innerHeight == document.body.scrollHeight => Reached the end of page.
