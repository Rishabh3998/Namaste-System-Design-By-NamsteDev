- What is state management ?

state is a dynamic data storage that provides a mechanism for components to manage, keep track of 
changing data, and trigger re-rendering when it is updated, and the management of these states in
the data layer of the components known as state management.

- Why do we need state ?

We need it to enable the dynamic behavior and the interactivity in the UI.

- What we need to know ?

1. Local state (Managed inside the components).
    -   Any dynamic data in the component.

2. Prop drilling concept.
    -   Unnecessary passing of props inside the unwanted components.

3. State management libraries.
    -   Redux, Zustand (A central place where our state exists)

4. Context API.
